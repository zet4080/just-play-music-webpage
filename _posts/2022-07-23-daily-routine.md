Create your daily practice routine with our practice planner and track your progress.

The Practice Planner creates a daily schedule for you with basic exercises that will help you quickly improve your skills.
These include scales in any key, rhythmic scales, dynamics, intervals, and technical exercises specific to your instrument.
You can record your session and get instant feedback on your exercise performance.

The Exercise Planner gives you a different set of exercises each day, but repeats exercises you haven't mastered yet more often than exercises you do well. It changes the required pace for exercises you have already mastered to make them more difficult.

You can access statistics for each exercise and track your progress for each exercise so you can see how far you've come.

You can create your own exercises, for example difficult parts from your current orchestra repertoire.

The exercise planner can analyze your exercises and take the information into account for the creation of your daily technique exercises. It will use the required keys or create rhythmic exercises for the difficult parts or use technique exercises that will help you with the difficult parts later.

You can give your teacher access to your exercise planner so he can select the exercises he thinks you should be working on.
If you wish, he will be notified when you have mastered the exercises he has selected so he can add new ones.

Conductors can also use the practice planner. They can distribute difficult parts of the current program to each instrument group and get statistics about practice performances and practice times. They can decide on the level of detail of these statistics, whether they are cumulated for the whole orchestra or broken down to the personal level.
